# JavaScript Code Linter

In this project, I used my knowledge of Ruby to build a code linter for detecting syntax errors in basic JavaScript code. The linter inspects each line of code in a JavaScript file, detects any syntax errors that may be present, and outputs a message describing each error that it finds.

The following are some examples of how the tool responds to good and bad code:

In the screenshot below, the first line in the function has incorrect indentation.

The linter detects this and indicates it to the user.

In the screenshot below, the indentation of line 7 is corrected.

The linter then detects that there are no more errors left in the code.

In the screenshot below, the curly braces of the add function are not closed.

## Built With
- Ruby

## Getting Started
- To make a copy of the project on your local machine, you can either download the project files in a zip folder or type git clone into your git commandline followed by the URL of this repository.
- Once you have downloaded a copy of the project to your local machine, navigate to the project directory, open the file named code.js, and write some basic JavaScript code in it.
- After you finish writing your JavaScript code in code.js, you can open your terminal in the project directory and run the code linter by entering 'ruby js_code_linter.rb' into your terminal.
- The code linter should then display messages to your terminal which describe any errors that may have been detected in your JavaScript code.
